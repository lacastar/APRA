/**
 * @dev Token vesting contract.
 *
 * APRA tokens can be locked for purchasing addresses. The workflow is the following:
 * 1) It is expected that 40% of the pruchased tokens are transferred to the buyer. (out of scope)
 * 2) The sender owns the tokens it wants to lock for the buyer.
 * 3) The sender grants enough allowance for this contract to transfer to itself the required amount of tokens.
 * 4) This contract increases the total amount of locked tokens for this account.
 * 5) The tokens are transferred from the sender to this account
 *
 * Every address can be queried for the actual or a given time for amount of tokens that can be currently withdrawn.
 * The formula for the withdrawal is 10% each months (every 30 days)
